# Introduction

**algo** is a cheat sheet for common data structures/algorithms.
Most of them are minimal implementations, making them ideal for
use in coding interviews, or anything that
requires you to write things from scratch.

Some of the data structures/algorithms include:

* Binary search
* Quicksort
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Disjoint Set
* Segment Tree
* Topological Sort

All examples in algo are implemented in Rust,
a strongly-typed, high-performance system programming language.
However, due to its easy-to-read nature, they can be ported
to other languages with minimal effort.
